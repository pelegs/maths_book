\chapter{Linear algebra\\(rigorous approach)}
Something about formalism, theorems, proofs, etc.

\begin{note}{Why present rigorous mathematics in this book?}{ }
	Rigorous mathematics is rarely necessary for those who are interested in the tools mathematics provides us with, rather than the full and deep understanding of the concepts these tools are based on. However, it can be useful to students of scientific fields to experience rigorous mathematics at least once in their course of study. Usually, the choice for the topic to be analyzed rigorously is between linear algebra and calculus - for this book the latter was chosen.
